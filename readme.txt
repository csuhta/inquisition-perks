DRAGON AGE: INQUISITION
INQUISITION PERKS GUIDE

Version 1.1.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
INTRODUCTION 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This is a guide to the Inquisition Perks system in Dragon Age: Inquisition.

The game doesn't do a very good job describing exactly what you're buying when
selecting a perk, so here we are.

THIS GUIDE CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS, MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF LOCATION AND QUEST 
NAMES. IT CONTAINS NO PLOT SPOILERS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
INFLUENCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You acquire perk points by gaining influence. When the meter fills up, you get 
a point to spend, and you rise to the next influence level. Each point 
requires more influence than the last. You can begin gaining influence
as soon as the game starts.

There are only 20 points total. This guide will help you spend them wisely.

You can gain influence in the following ways:

- Progress the story, make important decisions 
- Complete Inner Circle quests
- Complete war table missions
  Some missions give more influence for doing them "correctly"
- Capture keeps
- Slay dragons
- Close fade rifts
- Complete minor quests
- Purchase it with gold at the late-game Skyhold vendor

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
PERK REQUIREMENTS AND AGENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Some perks have requirements, such as a prerequisite perk or spending enough 
points in that perk tree. 

The most important thing to remember here is that acquiring Inquisition agents 
counts for point-prerequisites. So if you have three agents listed under 
Secrets, that counts as having 3 points spent in Secrets even though you 
didn't actually spend anything on the agents.

Listing each agent and how to get them is beyond the scope of this guide. 
There's a fantastic agent list by WadeAnthony on Reddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/2nh1n6/list_of_agents_spoilers/

I do have two notes for agents:

You should tell Speaker Anais that you want her to "listen and gather 
information", so that she becomes a Secrets agent. Quite a few of the Secrets 
perks are bad, so you need all of the help that you can get to avoid 
spending extra points in that tree.

You should tell Lord Berand to return home, so that he becomes a Connections 
agent. The alternative is Forces, which you will spending a lot of points 
in anyway. This conversation choice is counter-inutative, because
the Forces option on the wheel will mention joining the Inquisition, but you
have to pick the choice that feels like a rejection to get Connections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
THE SUGGESTED BUILD

Here's a quick summary of how I would build my Inquisition:

> Underworld Knowledge

6 leftover points

PERK NOTES AND DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

I've rated perks below and provided notes on what they actually do, distinct 
from their in-game description. Here's how the ratings work:

- Required
  These perks are blocking access to final gear, schematics, a quest, 
  or an agent. You HAVE to take these perks or you will miss things.

- Good
  These perks are worth spending points on. Some good perks become
  more important if you are playing on hard or nightmare difficulty.

- Poor
  These perks are really narrow, or give you boring items 
  and you can't afford to waste points on them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
UNDERWORLD KNOWLEDGE (FORCES)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Opens up new dialogue options related to criminal 
activities and grants +50% XP for each codex entry unlocked.

Rating: Required

This perk adds richer dialog options concerning criminals and war. You'll know 
when you're using this perk because the conversation wheel will show a book 
icon. Some of these conversation options allow you to recruit agents without 
the need for certain party members to be present. 

The XP boost for codex entries is for all entries, not just those concerning
criminals and war, and it stacks with the other boosts. The earlier you get 
this perk, the better.

You also need this perk if you want to recruit a certain male agent during 
Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MASSACHE'S METHOD (FORCES)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Grants a 5% increase in XP earned from killing foes.

Rating: Good

Only get this perk if you are still early in the game (before Skyhold). 
It becomes less worthwhile the longer you play. Keep in mind that you will 
definitely hit the soft level cap regardless of whether or not you take 
this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
RIDER'S POSTURE (FORCES)
Requires: 2 points in Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Training in proper weight distribution during hard riding 
significantly increases resistance to being unseated.

Rating: Very Poor

There are very few moments in the game where being thrown from your mount is 
an issue. Do not waste a point on this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ANTIVAN-STITCHED SADDLE (FORCES)
Requires: Rider's Posture
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Proper tack of fine Antivan leather, custom fitted to 
both horse and rider, significantly increase resistance to being unseated.

Rating: Very Poor

There are very few moments in the game where being thrown from your mount is 
an issue. Do not waste a point on this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ADVANCED FOCUS (FORCES)
Requires: 4 points in Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Increase Maximum Focus from 100 to 200. Second Tier Focus 
Effect for abilities can be triggered.

Rating: Good

Focus abilities are your late-game trump cards. Who doesn't want to make
giant green vortexes? You should get this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MASTER FOCUS (FORCES)
Requires: Advanced Focus
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Increase Maximum Focus from 200 to 300. Third-Tier Focus 
effect for abilities can now be triggered.

Rating: Good

See above. We are pro-vortex in this guide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
TRUE GRIT (FORCES)
Requires: Capturing any keep
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: All party members gain a 10% increase to all defenses.

Rating: Good

As of this writing, this perk is broken, and only affects the Inquisitor, not 
your entire party. It's up to you if you want it. You should get this
no matter what if you are playing on Hard or Nightmare.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MORE HEALING POTIONS (FORCES)
Requires: 3 points in Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Increases the maximum number of potions the party can 
carry to 4.

Rating: Good

This gives you 4 more stock in the Healing Potion slot (the automatic one). 
This isn't required for normal difficulty, but I consider it essential 
for anything harder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MAGE SCHEMATICS (FORCES)
Requires: 4 points in Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Provides new, rare schematics of mage armor and weapons

Rating: Poor

This perk will give you a one-time pack of tier 2 armor and weapon schematics 
for mages. Tier 2 equipment is not the best, tier 3 is. Don't buy this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ROGUE SCHEMATICS (FORCES)
Requires: 4 points in Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Provides new, rare schematics of rogue armor and weapons

Rating: Poor

This perk will give you a one-time pack of tier 2 armor and weapon schematics 
for rogues. Tier 2 equipment is not the best, tier 3 is. Don't buy this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
WARRIOR SCHEMATICS (FORCES)
Requires: 4 points in Forces
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Provides new, rare schematics of warrior armor and weapons

Rating: Poor

This perk will give you a one-time pack of tier 2 armor and weapon schematics 
for warriors. Tier 2 equipment is not the best, tier 3 is. Don't buy this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ARCANE KNOWLEDGE (SECRETS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Opens up new Dialogue options related to the Fade or 
Arcane Studies. Grants +50% XP for each codex entry unlocked.

Rating: Required

This perk adds richer dialog options concerning magic. You'll know 
when you're using this perk because the conversation wheel will show a book 
icon. Some of these conversation options allow you to recruit agents without 
the need for certain party members to be present. 

The XP boost for codex entries is for all entries, not just those concerning
magic, and it stacks with the other boosts. The earlier you get this perk, 
the better off you'll be.

You need this perk for some sentencing options to become available for Sit in 
Judgement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
OPTIMAL CUTTING (SECRETS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Grants a 10% change to receive extra herbs with each 
harvest.

Rating: Good

When harvesting herbs, you have a 10% chance to get up to 8 additional copies 
of that herb. This is surprisingly useful if you diligently harvest everything 
that you walk by.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
EAGLE-EYED (SECRETS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Grants a significant increase to the discovery range of 
the searching action.

Rating: AUUUGH NO

To be honest, I do not want my search radius to expand. I don't want to keep 
pinging the random Elfroot or ladder halfway across the valley. 

I find this perk infuriating, rather than helpful. However, this might be 
something that you, personally, want to get.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ENHANCED STUDIES (SECRETS)
Requires: 2 points in Secrets
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Grants an additional +50% XP for each foe studied, 
including those already completed.

Rating: Poor

You get more experience for turning in research items. This perk will also 
give you an immediate experience boost, retroactively, if you've already 
researched some monsters. Keep in mind that you will definitely hit the 
soft level cap regardless of whether or not you take this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
DEFT HANDS, FINE TOOLS (SECRETS)
Requires: 4 points in Secrets
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Allows all rogues in the party to open masterwork locks.

Rating: Required

You need this perk to complete some Inner Circle quests, and also to reach 
some of the better loot in the game. This perk is mandatory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
FORWARD SCOUTS (SECRETS)
Requires: Capture any keep
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Reveals additional landmarks and points of interest on 
the maps of every area.

Rating: Poor

This adds additional point-of-interest and "X" marks on your map. You don't 
need this perk in order to complete any of the landmark quests, and this perk 
does not add any additional warp points. Only get it if you like the flavor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
TRAINEE HERBALISTS (SECRETS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Gain a collection of Tier 1 Herbs.

Rating: Poor

This gives you a one-time package of herbs. You can gather herbs yourself, 
or grow them in Skyhold. Don't waste a point here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
VETERAN HERBALISTS (SECRETS)
Requires: Trainee Herbalists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: As part of the training push, a large collection of 
uncommon herbs will be delivered for personal use

Rating: Poor

This gives you a one-time package of herbs. You can gather herbs yourself, 
or grow them in Skyhold. Don't waste a point here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
MASTER HERBALISTS (SECRETS)
Requires: Veteran Herbalists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: A large collection of rare herbs will be delivered for 
personal use

Rating: Poor

This gives you a one-time package of herbs. You can gather herbs yourself, 
or grow them in Skyhold. Don't waste a point here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
NOBILITY KNOWLEDGE (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Detailed study of politics, rhetoric, and those who wield 
them to best effect. Opens up new dialogue options related to nobles and 
politics. Grants +50% XP for each codex entry unlocked.

Rating: Required

This perk adds richer dialog options concerning nobility. You'll know 
when you're using this perk because the conversation wheel will show a book 
icon. Some of these conversation options allow you to recruit agents without 
the need for certain party members to be present. 

The XP boost for codex entries is for all entries, not just those concerning
nobility, and it stacks with the other boosts. The earlier you get this 
perk, the better.

You need this perk to dance with the Dowager during Wicked Eyes and 
Wicked Hearts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
STERLING REPUTATION (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Merchants will pay the Inquisition 10% more for items 
sold to them.

Rating: Poor

You don't need this perk to make lots of money in this game. Only get it if 
you have no better alternative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
A FAVOR FOR A FAVOR (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Merchants will offer the Inquisition a 10% discount on 
their goods.

Rating: Poor

You don't need this perk to make lots of money in this game. Only get it if 
you have no better alternative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ELITE CLIENTELE (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: Sterling Reputation and A Favor for a Favor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Shops offer to buy and sell for 15% better prices.

Rating: Poor

If you got the two prerequisite perks, you probably don't need to spend a 
third point on this perk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
THE RARE STOCKS (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Inquisition procurers can leverage the organization's 
reputation to purchase a shipment of rare and valuable raw materials for 
crafting.

Rating: Poor

This perk gives you a one-time pack of teir 1 metals and cloth, about 10 
of each kind. You can gather these yourself, and even buy some of them 
from merchants. Spend your points elsewhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
EXACTING BUYERS (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: The Rare Stocks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: A little shrewd negotiation will allow inquisition 
procurers to buy a shipment of high-quality materials for their craftsmen.

Rating: Poor

This perk gives you a one-time pack of teir 2 metals and cloth, about 10 
of each kind. You can gather these yourself, and even buy some of them 
from merchants. Spend your points elsewhere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ONLY THE FINEST (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: Exacting Buyers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: A word to the right people, and our Inquisition procurers 
can bid at auction on the very highest-quality, rare materials for their 
craftsmen.

Rating: Poor

This perk gives you a one-time pack of teir 3 metals and cloth, about 10 
of each kind. You can gather these yourself. While this perk might be 
somewhat worth it, the two other points you'd have to spend to get there 
are not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
THE SHORT LIST (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: 5 points in Connections
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Merchants eager to win favor from the Inquisition will 
give access to special offers for rare inventory.

Rating: Required

When you have this perk, most merchants will add additional rare items to 
their inventory list. When a merchant is showing a rare item, that tab of 
their store window will have a star mark above it.

The rare item for each merchant rotates between a set list. If they don't have 
what you want, map completely out and back into that zone to refresh their 
inventory. Sometimes it seems like they're not changing their offering, but 
believe me, they are. RNG just hates you. Just keep mapping out and back in 
and you'll get it.

This perk is the only way to get some T3 masterwork schematics from the 
Hissing Wastes and Emprise du Lion merchants, and the only way to get certain 
unique items. You like fancy equipment, right? GET THIS PERK.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES (CONNECTIONS)
Requires: Capture any keep
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Merchants will send messages when they have sales at 
their stores in hopes the Inquisitor will put in an appearance.

Rating: Poor

When you have this perk, you can ask Josephine for information about which 
merchants are having a sale. If you visit them, they will offer you a 
temporary discount. This perk is not useful enough to spend a point on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
HISTORY KNOWLEDGE (INQUISITION)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Opens up new dialogue options related to history and the 
Chantry. Grants an additional +50% XP for each codex entry found.

Rating: Good

This perk adds richer dialog options concerning history and religion. 
You'll know when you're using this perk because the conversation wheel 
will show a book icon. Some of these conversation options allow you to 
recruit agents without the need for certain party members to be present. 

The XP boost for codex entries is for all entries, not just those concerning
history, and it stacks with the other boosts. The earlier you get this 
perk, the better.

This perk's rating is currently "Good" because it doesn't seem like it's 
required for any missable agents or story steps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
ANTIVAN TAILORING (INQUISITION)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Increases inventory capacity by 15.

Rating: Good

You don't have to expand your inventory capacity for any reason except 
convenience, but you will have to empty out your bags much more often without 
this perk. You have to spend some points in Inquisition eventually, 
so you might as well get this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
IMPERIAL COURT TAILORING (INQUISITION)
Requires: Antivan Tailoring
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Increases inventory capacity by 15.

Rating: Good

If you aren't having inventory trouble, you don't have to get this second bag 
upgrade.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
TEMPERED GLASS FLASKS (INQUISITION)
Requires: None
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Adds one more potion slot for all party members.

Rating: Required

This lets each party member keep one more type of potion on their belt. 
Since your first two potion slots will likely be reserved for defensive 
or healing potions, you should take this so that you can have room for an 
offensive potion. 

Absolutely required on harder difficulties. No one will be safe from your 
potion bottle litter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
EXCLUSIVE TRAINING (INQUISITION)
Requires: 4 points in Inquisition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In-game Description: Gain 1 combat ability point, for the Inquisitor only.

Rating: Required

You need all of the ability points that you can get on the Inquisitor. Don't 
skip this perk.
